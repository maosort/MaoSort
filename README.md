# Mao Zedong Sort: A (Cultural) Revolutionary Approach to Sort in O(1) Complexity


## 1 Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and plays a crucial role in various applications, from database management to information retrieval. Traditional sorting algorithms such as QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort have been extensively studied and optimized. However, their performance is restricted by O(nlogn) complexity. A recent breakthrough in this area drew inspiration from Stalin, a prominent leader of the Soviet Union. [Stalin Sort](https://github.com/gustavo-depaula/stalin-sort) is capable of reducing the time complexity to O(n).

Inspired by its elegant design, the Mao Zedong Sorting (MaoSort) Algorithm is a unique and innovative approach to sorting data that draws inspiration from the revolutionary ideas and strategies of Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China. This algorithm, developed by computer scientists seeking unconventional solutions to traditional problems, has the potential to provide new insights into the field of data sorting. In this document, we present a detailed overview of the Mao Zedong Sorting Algorithm, its principles, and its practical applications, highlighting its potential advantages.

The following content will assume that we are sorting elements in ascending order. It is easy to make it the other way.

## 2 MaoSort Design

The design of MaoSort follows Mao's thoughts on revolution, class struggle, and redistribution.

### 2.1 Principle of Class Struggle

The principle of class struggle governs how we treat an element encountered during sorting. If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, it will be labeled as "revolutionary class" and will be kept in its position. If the current element is smaller than the previous element, it will be labeled as "counter-revolutionary class," also known as "right-wing intellectual," and will be instantly dropped, a process referred to as "sent to Jia Bian Gou." A similar operation can be found in Stalin Sort, known as "sent to Gulag."

### 2.2 Food Quota Mechanism

The principle of class struggle alone does not significantly improve the algorithm's performance, as it follows a similar design to Stalin Sort. Therefore, we propose the food quota mechanism to further reduce its complexity.

Essentially, we will define a variable called the "Food Quota" and set it to be a constant much smaller than the number of elements we are trying to sort. This mechanism is also known as a "natural disaster." With this mechanism, when sorting a group of numbers, if the iteration of class struggle comparisons reaches the "Food Quota," the algorithm will stop running and drop all elements beyond that point. This allows us to obtain a sorted list.

### 2.3 Time Complexity Analysis

Assuming that comparing two elements takes O(1) time to execute, the time complexity with only the principle of class struggle will be O(n) for all the elements. With the "Food Quota," the algorithm stops running after "Food Quota" iterations. Since the "Food Quota" is a small constant, we can conclude that our algorithm takes O(1) time to execute.

Next, we provide the psudocode of MaoSort.

```
Function: MaoSort
Input: A list that contains all the elements to be sorted, called Population
Output: A sorted list, Population

MaoSort(List: Population):
    FoodQuota := a small constant number
    PreviousElement := MIN_NUM

    Foreach Element in Population:
        If FoodQuota <= 0:
            break
        End If
        FoodQuota--
        If Element < PreviousElement:
            Population.erase(Element)
        Else:
            PreviousElement := Element
        End If
    End Foreach
End MaoSort
```

## 3 A Working Example

In this section, we give a specific example of MaoSort.

(1966, 1954, 1967, 1968, 1955, 1969, 1956, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1959, 1960, 1961)

If we have an array like this, "Food Quota" will be set to 14.

Starting from the second element, since 1954 is smaller than 1966, it will be treated as a "counter-revolutionary class" and droped. Then, we get

(1966, 1967, 1968, 1955, 1969, 1956, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1959, 1960, 1961)

and "Food Quota" will decease by 1, becomes 13. This time, 1967 is greater than 1966, we keep it and moving on. After 14 iteration, "Food Quota" will become 0 when we reaches 1959, so all the elements after this point will be dropped.

The final result is 

(1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976)

Clearly, the result is a cultural revolution in sorting algorithms.

The elements classified into "counter-revolutionary class" are {1954, 1955, 1956}. And the elements that are dropped because there is no "Food Quota" are {1959, 1960 and 1961}, which shows our "natrual disaster" mechanism is working really good.

## 4 Participation

We encourage everyone to participate into this cultural revolutionary algorithm and implement it in any language you want.
